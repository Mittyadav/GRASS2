![GRASS](assets/img1.jpg)

This repository contains the code for `GRASS`, a bot designed to establish WebSocket connections through various HTTP and SOCKS proxies, specifically aimed at farming for Grass Airdrop Season 2.

---

## OVERVIEW

`GRASS` connects to a specified WebSocket server using both HTTP and SOCKS proxies. It leverages the `ws` library for WebSocket communication and integrates the `https-proxy-agent` and `socks-proxy-agent` libraries for enhanced proxy support. This allows for more versatile and resilient connections, accommodating a wider range of proxy types.

- Paste the following command and press Enter:

  ```javascript
  localStorage.getItem('userId');
  ```

- Copy the value returned, which is your user ID.

   ```text
   123123213
   123123123
   ```

3. To specify proxies, create a file named `proxy_list.txt` in the project directory and add your desired proxy URLs, following the same new-line format, like this:

   ```text
   http://username:password@hostname:port
